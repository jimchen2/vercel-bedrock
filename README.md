I need to use Bedrock, and LobeChat performs poorly, I am NOT using a database here, so every conversation will be gone if the tab is closed

## Todo

1. Add Images as Input
2. Add Conversation style
3. Add max input count
4. Support different models on Bedrock
5. Add PWA support
6. Add Authentication for both the frontend and backend
